# ableC tensor algebra compiler
A tensor algebra compiler for ableC based on the paper *The Tensor Algebra Compiler* by Fredrik Kjolstad, et. al.

## Todo
* Handle duplicate tensor use in tensor expressions.
* Extend test-suite to test correctness of code gen
* Fix tensor computation in assignment to scalar.
* Implement sparse and dense functions over tensor accesses for tensor expressions
* Investigate and implement loop parallelization where possible
* Add check for including tensors.xh header file
* Find nice examples
