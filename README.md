# ableC tensor algebra compiler
A tensor algebra compiler for ableC based on the paper *The Tensor Algebra Compiler* by Fredrik Kjolstad, et. al.

## Todo
* Move off of parseXXX and move to ableC\_XXX.
* Add check for including tensors.xh header file
* Test OpenMP code generation more
* Extend test-suite to test correctness of code gen
* Add user guide to README
* Find nice examples
* Implement sparse and dense functions over tensor accesses for tensor expressions
