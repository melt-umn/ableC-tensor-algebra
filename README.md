# ableC tensor algebra compiler
A tensor algebra compiler for ableC based on the paper *The Tensor Algebra Compiler* by Fredrik Kjolstad, et. al.

## Todo
* Add support for function overloading on edu:umn:cs:melt:exts:ableC:tensorAlgebra:tensor to support tensor access and tensor modification. This should then extend into tensor expressions using assignment overloading and index variable.
