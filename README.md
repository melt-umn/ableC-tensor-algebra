# ableC tensor algebra compiler
A tensor algebra compiler for ableC based on the paper *The Tensor Algebra Compiler* by Fredrik Kjolstad, et. al.

## Todo
* OpenMP code generation needs to be tested more.
* Extend test-suite to test correctness of code gen
* Implement sparse and dense functions over tensor accesses for tensor expressions
* Add check for including tensors.xh header file
* Find nice examples
* Implement string show using string extension
